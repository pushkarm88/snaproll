# snaproll
A software to roll the photos in a format to fit on laptop/TV screens. Whenever a photo is clicked then based on the orientation it is skewed to some angle (sometimes straight to fit on the screens and sometimes right or left directions).  This software rolls all the images in a folder and subfolder to an appropriate angle to view on laptop/TV. The software is useful when you have too many photos that needs to be corrected to view on laptop/TV screens. Instead of opening and rotating each photo, just right click on the folder and select “Snap Roll” and see the magic.
