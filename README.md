# snaproll
A software to roll the photos in a format to fit on laptop/TV screens. Whenever a photo is clicked then based on the orientation it is skewed to some angle (sometimes straight to fit on the screens and sometimes right or left directions).  This software rolls all the images in a folder and subfolder to an appropriate angle to view on laptop/TV. The software is useful when you have too many photos that needs to be corrected to view on laptop/TV screens. Instead of opening and rotating each photo, just right click on the folder and select “Snap Roll” and see the magic.

Limitation on this version 1.0:
Currently, this software is applicable to JPG/JPEG formats and works on the images/photos taken from any mobile/camera means if you rotate the image deliberately on the computer then it won’t work.
If the photo is clicked from any device and it appears skewed then this software will rolls them appropriately.

The second version will be launched later and work on different formats to overcome the limitations of current version.

Installation:
Just 2 clicks required to install this software.

How to use?
You just need to right click on the folder containing the photos or the subfolders containing the photos and select the “Snap Roll” option from the right click menu.
Wait for the magic :)

After completion, it will prompt a message to the user.
